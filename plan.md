- Align task row elements (checkbox, star, text, delete) horizontally with vertical centering.
- Reduce excess spacing between the task list and the add-task section for visual balance.

## Next Steps
- Address each pending item above and perform a verification pass covering cursor mode, settings UI, task lists, and insights.
